Algorithms
==========
I'm writing algorithms to learn to write more efficient code focused on speed, memory, and size. Here is a list of resources that I study with and use:

1. Learn Software by Books-A meetup lead by Raymond Gan, Sundays, 7pm-10pm PST (http://www.meetup.com/software-books/about/).
2. Sedgewick, R. & Wayne, K. (2008). Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Addison-Wesley.

3. Khan Academy-https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms
